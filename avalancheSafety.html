		<h3>What is an Avalanche</h3>
		<p>An avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, often triggered by various factors such as snowpack instability, weather conditions, or human activity. </p>

			Types of Avalanches
		</h1>

<div class="MediaandImageCarousel">

		<img src="imgs/avSafety/wetSnowAvalanche610x425.jpg" width="610" height="425" alt="A wet snow Avalanche">
		<h3>Wet Snow Avalanche</h3>

		<p>Wet avalanches occur when warm temperatures or rain melt the snowpack, causing it to become unstable and flow downhill like a slushy mass. Wet avalanches are common during springtime or in regions with a maritime climate where temperatures fluctuate above and below freezing.</p>

</div>

<div class="MediaandImageCarousel">

		<img src="imgs/avSafety/powderSnowAvalanche610x425.jpg" width="610" height="425" alt="A wet snow Avalanche">
		<h3>Powder Snow Avalanche</h3>

		<p>Powder avalanches, also known as dry loose snow avalanches, differ from other types in that they involve dry, unconsolidated snow rather than cohesive slabs. These avalanches typically occur on steep slopes with a fresh accumulation of light, dry snow, and they can be triggered by various factors such as a sudden increase in slope angle, a disturbance like the collapse of a cornice, or the crossing of a skier or snowboarder. Powder avalanches are characterized by their billowing clouds of snow as they flow downhill.</p>

</div>

<div class="MediaandImageCarousel">

		<img src="imgs/avSafety/slabAvalanche610x425.jpg" width="610" height="425" alt="A wet snow Avalanche">
		<h3>Slab Snow Avalanche</h3>

		<p>Slab avalanches occur when a cohesive layer of snow breaks loose from the surrounding snowpack, often due to weak layers beneath it. These weak layers can be formed by factors like temperature gradients, wind loading, or variations in snow density. Slab avalanches are typically the most dangerous type and can propagate across large areas of terrain.</p>

</div>

<div class="MediaandImageCarousel">

		<img src="imgs/avSafety/looseSnowAvalanche610x425.jpg" width="610" height="425" alt="A wet snow Avalanche">
		<h3>Loose Snow Avalanche</h3>

		<p>Loose snow avalanches, also called sluffs, occur when individual grains or small pockets of snow become dislodged and cascade downhill. Sluffs are often triggered by a disturbance such as a skier or snowboarder traversing a slope, and while they are generally smaller than slab avalanches, they can still pose a threat, especially in steep terrain.</p>

		<img src="imgs/avSafety/Suffocation180x180.jpg" width="180" height="180" alt="icon of a face with an x over their mouth">
		<h3> Suffocation</h3>
		<p>The most common cause of death in avalanches is suffocation. When an avalanche occurs, snow rushes downhill, carrying debris and entrapping air within the moving mass. As the avalanche comes to a stop, the snow settles and compacts, creating a dense layer that can make it difficult or impossible for victims to breathe. This phenomenon, known as "snow burial," can lead to suffocation due to a lack of oxygen. Victims buried under snow may also struggle to free themselves, further increasing the risk of suffocation.</p>

	<div class="Card">
		<img src="imgs/avSafety/Injury180x180.jpg" width="180" height="180" alt="icon of a face with an x over their mouth">
		<h3> Injury</h3>
		<p>Avalanches can cause various injuries to individuals caught in their path. Victims may be struck by debris such as rocks, trees, or chunks of ice carried by the avalanche, leading to traumatic injuries such as fractures, lacerations, or head injuries. Additionally, the powerful force of the moving snow can cause blunt force trauma as victims are carried downhill or collide with objects in the avalanche path. Even in the absence of direct impact, individuals may sustain injuries from being tossed and tumbled within the turbulent flow of the avalanche.</p>

	<div class="Card">
		<img src="imgs/avSafety/Hypothermia180x180.jpg" width="180" height="180" alt="icon of a face with an x over their mouth">
		<h3> Hypothermia</h3>
		<p>Avalanche victims are also at risk of hypothermia, a condition characterized by dangerously low body temperatures. Even if not buried, individuals caught in avalanches are exposed to freezing temperatures, wind, and wet snow, which can quickly lead to hypothermia, especially if they are not adequately dressed for the conditions. Hypothermia can set in rapidly and impair cognitive and physical functions, making it difficult for victims to survive without prompt rescue and medical attention.</p>

<section id="WeatherPatterns" class="full-columns">
	<h1>Weather Patterns</h1>
	<p><strong> In terms of avalanche causation, weather patterns play a crucial role in determining avalanche risk. Certain weather conditions can increase the likelihood of avalanches, while others may reduce the risk. Here's an overview of high-risk and low-risk weather patterns associated with avalanche causation:

		Safety Precautions
	</h1>
	<p>
		Avalanche safety is crucial for anyone venturing into mountainous terrain during the winter months. Whether you're a backcountry skier, snowboarder, snowshoer, or mountaineer, being prepared and practicing avalanche safety can help minimize the risk of accidents. Here are some important avalanche safety tips for both yourself and others:

		<h3> Avalanche Transceiver (Beacon)</h3>
		<p>An avalanche transceiver, also known as a beacon, is a vital piece of equipment that emits a signal and can receive signals from other transceivers. In the event of an avalanche burial, rescuers use transceivers to locate buried victims by homing in on their signals. Transceivers should be worn over the clothing, close to the body's centre, and always kept in transmit mode when traveling in avalanche terrain.</p>

		<h3> Avalanche Probe</h3>
		<p>An avalanche probe is a collapsible pole used to pinpoint the location of a buried avalanche victim. Probes are inserted into the snowpack to determine the victim's depth and facilitate more precise probing during the rescue process. Lightweight, aluminum probes that extend to at least 240 centimetres are recommended for efficient probing in deep snow.</p>

		<h3> Avalanche Shovel</h3>
		<p>An avalanche shovel is used for digging out buried victims during avalanche rescue operations. Look for a sturdy, lightweight shovel with a durable blade and a telescoping or collapsible handle for compact storage. A shovel with a metal blade is preferable for cutting through dense avalanche debris.</p>

		<h3> Avalanche Airbag Pack</h3>
		<p>An avalanche airbag pack is a specialized backpack equipped with an integrated airbag system designed to help increase the chances of survival in an avalanche. When deployed, the airbag helps to keep the wearer near the surface of the avalanche debris by increasing their volume and reducing burial depth. While not a substitute for avalanche rescue gear, an avalanche airbag can provide an additional layer of protection in certain situations.</p>

		<h3> Helmet</h3>
		<p>A helmet is an essential piece of safety equipment for protecting against head injuries during avalanche incidents and other backcountry activities. Choose a helmet specifically designed for skiing, snowboarding, or mountaineering, with features such as adjustable fit systems, ventilation, and impact-absorbing materials.</p>

		<h3> Avalanche Safety Gear Backpack</h3>
		<p>A backpack designed for carrying avalanche safety gear is essential for organizing and securely storing your equipment while traveling in avalanche terrain. Look for a backpack with dedicated compartments or sleeves for your avalanche transceiver, probe, shovel, and other essentials, as well as features like ski or snowboard carry options and hydration compatibility.</p>
